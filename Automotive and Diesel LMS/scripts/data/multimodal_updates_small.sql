## Safety and Verification Checklist

* Ensure the vehicle is parked on a level surface.
* Engage the parking brake.
* Put the transmission in park (if applicable).

## Steps to Follow:

1. Identify the type of electric motor used in the vehicle. Typically, EVs use either induction or permanent magnet motors.
2. Locate the power electronics module (PEM) which controls the flow of electrical energy from the battery to the motor.
3. Understand how the regenerative braking system works, allowing the vehicle to recharge its batteries during deceleration.
4. Familiarize yourself with the inverter and its role in converting DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor.
5. Identify the type of transmission used (if any). Some EVs use a single-speed or multi-speed transmission, while others may have no transmission at all.
6. Verify that the vehicle's electrical system is properly connected and secured.$__MD__$, audio_script = $__MD__$Welcome to Lesson 1: EV Drivetrain Overview. In this lesson, we'll be covering the key components of an electric vehicle's drivetrain. First, let's talk about safety. Make sure you're in a well-ventilated area, away from any open flames or sparks. Now, let's get started.

The first component is the electric motor. This can either be an induction motor or a permanent magnet motor. The power electronics module, or PEM, controls the flow of electrical energy from the battery to the motor.

Next up is regenerative braking. This system allows the vehicle to recharge its batteries during deceleration. It's essentially a way for the vehicle to recover some of that kinetic energy and turn it back into electricity.

Now, let's talk about the inverter. This component converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor. Some EVs use a single-speed or multi-speed transmission, while others may have no transmission at all.

That's a basic overview of an electric vehicle's drivetrain. Remember to always follow proper safety procedures when working with electrical systems.$__MD__$, practice_activities = $__MD__$[{"type": "scenario", "title": "Scenario: Troubleshooting an EV Motor", "description": "You're working on an electric vehicle and the motor is not functioning properly.
