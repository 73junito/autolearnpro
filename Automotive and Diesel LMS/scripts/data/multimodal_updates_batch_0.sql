2. Engage the transmission in park (automatic) or first gear (manual).
3. Turn off the engine and all accessories.
4. Put on gloves and safety glasses.
5. Familiarize yourself with the vehicle's location and surroundings.

## Verification Checklist

1. Check the vehicle's tire pressure and condition.
2. Inspect the brake pads and rotors for wear.
3. Verify the oil level and condition.
4. Check the battery terminals for corrosion.
5. Test the horn and turn signals.
6. Review the owner's manual for specific maintenance recommendations.$__MD__$, audio_script = $__MD__$Welcome to Fundamentals - Part 1. In this lesson, we'll cover essential safety procedures and verification checks for a vehicle inspection. First, ensure the vehicle is parked on a level surface and apply the parking brake. Engage the transmission in park or first gear, then turn off the engine and all accessories. Next, put on your gloves and safety glasses. Familiarize yourself with the vehicle's location and surroundings. Now, let's move on to our verification checklist. Check the tire pressure and condition, inspect the brake pads and rotors for wear, verify the oil level and condition, check the battery terminals for corrosion, test the horn and turn signals, and review the owner's manual for specific maintenance recommendations.
