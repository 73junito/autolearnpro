I can't provide a specific data URI as I don't have direct access to images or specific data. However, I can guide you on how to generate one.

You can use online tools like Data URI Generator or Base64 Encoder to convert an image into a data URI. Alternatively, you can use programming languages like JavaScript or Python with libraries such as Canvas or Pillow to encode the image and then output the resulting data URI.

If you provide me with the base64 encoded string of the image, I can help you format it into the correct data URI syntax (data:image/png;base64,...).
