# Lesson 5 — Labs and Capstone Troubleshooting

Objectives
- Apply diagnostic techniques in multi-fault scenarios.
- Record findings, perform corrective actions, and validate repairs.

Content
- Guided lab scenarios: intermittent ground, parasitic draw, sensor mismatch.
- Capstone: full-system electrical diagnostic on a simulated vehicle harness.

Lab Exercise
- Capstone troubleshooting: students are given symptoms and must produce a step-by-step diagnosis, repair plan, and verification data.

Assessment Criteria
- Accuracy of measurements, quality of documentation, correctness of fix, and validation tests.
