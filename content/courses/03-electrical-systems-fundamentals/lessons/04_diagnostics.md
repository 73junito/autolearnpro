# Lesson 4 — Component Testing and Diagnostics

Objectives
- Test batteries, starters, alternators, sensors, and actuators.
- Diagnose common wiring faults: opens, shorts, high resistance, bad grounds.
- Use step-by-step diagnostic flowcharts for systematic troubleshooting.

Content
- Battery state-of-charge vs. state-of-health tests.
- Starter draw tests, voltage drop testing, and alternator output verification.
- Sensor testing using voltage, resistance, and waveform patterns.

Lab Exercise
- Perform a full charging system check and document findings using a provided template.

Resources
- Voltage drop test procedure
- Diagnostic flowchart templates
