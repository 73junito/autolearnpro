<!-- Lab: Multimeter Practice --> # Lab: Multimeter Practice — Safe Measurements

## Objective

Practice taking DC voltage, continuity, and resistance measurements on benign circuits
and record results.

## Setup

- Work in pairs in the shop area with instructor supervision. - Equipment: DMM, test
leads, sample wiring harness or bench power supply, 12 V lamp or resistor.

## Tasks

1. Measure the resting battery voltage and record the value. 2. Build a simple series
circuit (battery, resistor, lamp) and measure voltage across and current through the
resistor. 3. Use continuity mode to verify harness connectors and identify open
circuits.

## Deliverable

- Upload a photo of the multimeter showing the measured voltage for task 1. - Submit a
short text entry with recorded values for task 2 and a brief interpretation.

## Safety

- Disconnect the battery when changing wiring. Use insulated tools when necessary.
