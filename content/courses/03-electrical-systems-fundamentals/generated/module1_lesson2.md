# Lesson 2 — Fluids, Maintenance & Safety (25 minutes)

## Brake fluid types and properties

- DOT3, DOT4, DOT5/5.1 differences (glycol vs silicone, hygroscopic behavior)
- Boiling point, contamination risks, and why periodic flushing matters

## Maintenance procedures

- Checking reservoir level and fluid condition
- Identifying contamination (dark color, odor) and recommended replacement intervals

## Safety

- PPE: gloves, eye protection
- Proper disposal of brake fluid

## Classroom activity

Inspect a sealed sample vial with brake fluid and note color and relative viscosity. Discuss signs that require service.
<!-- Lesson: Electrical Fundamentals --> # Electrical Fundamentals — Basic Theory

## Learning Objectives

- Explain voltage, current, and resistance in simple terms. - Apply Ohm's law to compute
expected voltages or currents for basic circuits.

## Key Concepts

### Voltage (V)

- The electrical potential difference; measured in volts.

### Current (I)

- Flow of charge measured in amperes (A).

### Resistance (R)

- Opposition to current, measured in ohms (Ω).

## Ohm's Law

$$V = I \times R$$

## Worked Example

- If a sensor circuit draws 0.2 A through a 10 Ω resistor, V = 0.2 × 10 = 2.0 V.

## Practical Notes

- Many automotive sensors use low-voltage reference circuits; always verify manufacturer
specs.

## Instructor Notes

- Include a short practice calculating simple series/parallel values.
