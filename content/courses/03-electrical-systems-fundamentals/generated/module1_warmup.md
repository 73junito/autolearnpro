# Module 1 — Warm-Up (5 minutes)

Activity: Quick diagnostic scenario

Read the short scenario below and post a one-paragraph prediction of the most likely cause and one question you'd ask a technician.

Scenario: A customer reports a soft brake pedal and a squeal when braking after the vehicle sat overnight. No visible fluid leaks. The vehicle had recent brake pad replacement two months ago.

Prompts:
- What are three quick checks you would perform on arrival?
- What tools would you prepare for a hands-on inspection?
