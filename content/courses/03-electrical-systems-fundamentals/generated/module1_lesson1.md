# Lesson 1 — Hydraulic Principles & Brake Components (25 minutes)

## Concept: Fluids under pressure

- Pascal's principle: pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished.
- How force multiplication works between master cylinder and wheel cylinders/calipers.

## Components overview

- Master cylinder, reservoir
- Brake lines and hoses
- Calipers, wheel cylinders, brake pads/shoes
- ABS modulator and sensors (brief overview)

## Visuals / Diagrams

Include a labeled brake system diagram (teacher-provided image). Point out master cylinder, proportioning valve, calipers, and lines.

## Quick demo

Show a short video (3–4 min) demonstrating brake pedal force vs. caliper piston movement and pad contact.
<!-- Lesson: Multimeter Basics --> # Multimeter Basics

## Learning Objectives

- Identify multimeter functions: DC voltage, continuity, resistance. - Take basic DC
voltage and continuity readings safely.

## Materials

- Digital multimeter (DMM) - Vehicle battery or 12 V power source - Test leads,
backprobe pins

## Step-by-step Procedure

1. Inspect the multimeter and leads for damage; set to the correct measurement (DCV for
battery). 2. Connect the black lead to COM, red lead to V/Ω input. 3. For DC voltage:
place red probe to positive terminal, black probe to negative/ground. Expect ~12.4–12.8
V for a resting automotive battery. 4. For continuity: set meter to continuity/beep
mode, place probes across the component or wire; a beep indicates a low-resistance path.

> Safety: Do not measure resistance on a live circuit — remove power before measuring
ohms or continuity.

## Examples

- Battery voltage: 12.6 V (healthy resting battery) - Shorted circuit: continuity beep
across connector pins indicates low resistance

## Quick Check

- Demonstrate a voltage reading and record the value.

## Instructor Notes

- Emphasize correct meter range and input selection to avoid meter damage.
