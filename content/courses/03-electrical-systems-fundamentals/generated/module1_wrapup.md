# Wrap-Up — Key Takeaways

- Brake systems use hydraulic force transmission (Pascal's principle).
- Regular brake fluid maintenance prevents contamination and reduces boiling risk.
- Safety and correct procedure are essential for bleeding and inspections.

## Real-world connection

Proper brake maintenance improves stopping distance and reduces warranty failures—critical for technician employability.
