# Module 1 — Hydraulics & Brake Fundamentals

**Estimated time:** 3 hours

## Short description
Introduce hydraulic principles, brake fluid properties, and common brake system components. This module builds foundational knowledge and measurement skills used in later diagnostics and labs.

## Learning objectives

- Explain Pascal's principle and its application to automotive brake systems.
- Identify major brake system components and their function.
- Describe brake fluid types, maintenance intervals, and contamination signs.
- Perform basic brake system inspections and safe bleeding procedures (lab preparation).

## How to use this module

Work through the warm-up first (5 minutes), then complete the core lessons (2 × ~25 minutes). Do the guided practice in-class. The assignment is a hands-on lab with rubric. End with the self-check.

— Overview & Objectives

## Learning Objectives

- Identify required PPE and workshop safety procedures for electrical work. - Describe
basic multimeter use and safe measurement practices. - Recognize common wiring colors
and connector types in automotive systems.

## Summary

This module introduces shop safety, required tools, and an introduction to the
multimeter. Students will learn how to take safe DC voltage, continuity, and resistance
measurements and interpret basic results.

## Key Concepts

### Shop Safety

- Always wear safety glasses and appropriate footwear. - Isolate circuits and remove
vehicle keys before testing when required.

### Tools Covered

- Digital multimeter (DMM) - Basic hand tools (insulated if working near live circuits)
