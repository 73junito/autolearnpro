Storybook for Student Dashboard

Run Storybook locally (after installing deps):

```bash
npm install --prefix catalog-root
npm run storybook --prefix catalog-root
```

Notes:
- Stories are under `student-dashboard/components/*.stories.tsx`.
- Preview imports `student-dashboard/styles/style.css` to style components.
