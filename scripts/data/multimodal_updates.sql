1. Inspect the brake system for visible leaks, rust, or damage.
2. Check the parking brake is securely engaged and can be easily disengaged.
3. Test the emergency brake by applying it firmly while the vehicle is stationary.
4. Inspect the brake pedal for any softness or excessive travel.
5. Verify that the brake lights are functioning properly when the brakes are applied.
**Verification checklist**
- Check for proper parking brake operation
- Inspect brake system for leaks, rust, or damage
- Test emergency brake functionality
- Check brake pedal feel and brake light operation
6. Perform a road test to ensure proper braking during normal and emergency situations.
7. Conduct a post-drive inspection to verify that the parking brake is still securely engaged.$__MD__$, audio_script = $__MD__$Welcome back to Auto Diesel, where we focus on keeping your diesel engine running smoothly. Today's lesson is all about brake safety. Before we get started, let me ask you a question - have you ever had any issues with your brakes while driving?
(pause) If so, you're not alone. Brakes are one of the most critical components in any vehicle, and it's essential to keep them well-maintained.
(pause) So let's dive into our lesson on brake safety. First things first - check your brakes for visible leaks, rust, or damage.
(pause) Next up is the parking brake. Make sure it's securely engaged and can be easily disengaged.
(pause) Now, test the emergency brake by applying it firmly while the vehicle is stationary.
(pause) Check the brake pedal for any softness or excessive travel - that could indicate a problem.
(pause) Finally, verify that your brake lights are functioning properly when the brakes are applied. If you're unsure about any of these steps, don't hesitate to consult with a professional.
(pause) After completing these steps, take your vehicle on a road test to ensure proper braking during normal and emergency situations. And remember, always check your parking brake again after driving.
(pause) I hope this lesson helps you stay safe on the road.
