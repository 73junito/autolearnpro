  "audio_script": "Welcome to the Brake Safety lesson. Brakes are critical to vehicle safety—this script will guide you through key checks, reasons behind them, and actions to take when you find issues. (pause) Start by preparing your workspace: make sure you have the correct PPE, wheels chocked, and the vehicle supported safely. Consult the vehicle service manual for model-specific procedures and torque values before beginning. (pause) Visually inspect all brake components: look for fluid leaks at the master cylinder, hoses, and fittings; check rotors for scoring or heat spots; and inspect pads for abnormal wear patterns. Any sign of leakage or damage requires stopping work and addressing the root cause before proceeding. (pause) Next, check the parking brake operation—engage and disengage it to confirm smooth function. If the parking brake sticks or releases unevenly, diagnose the cable, lever, or actuator for corrosion, binding, or adjustment needs. (pause) When assessing pedal feel, perform a controlled low-speed test: press the pedal steadily and note firmness and travel. Soft or spongy pedal travel can indicate air in the hydraulic system or a fluid leak; address these immediately. (pause) Always replace components that are below manufacturer service limits—temporary repairs can create hazards. When reinstalling parts, use a calibrated torque wrench and apply the specified torque values to fasteners. (pause) After reassembly, perform a road test in a safe area to validate braking performance under normal and emergency conditions. Watch for pulling, noises, vibration, or fading—each signals a different failure mode requiring follow-up. (pause) Finish by documenting measurements, replaced parts, and the verification checklist in the service record. If anything is unclear during inspection or testing, stop and consult a senior technician or the service manual. Safety first—if in doubt, secure the vehicle and seek assistance.",
