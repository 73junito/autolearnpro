# Question Bank Scaling Plan for 10,000 Students
## Comprehensive Strategy for 60,000+ Verified Questions

**Target Population:** 10,000 concurrent students  
**Target Question Bank:** 60,000-75,000 questions  
**Current Status:** 35 questions (25 verified with credible sources)  
**Duplication Probability Goal:** <1% chance of seeing same question twice

---

## Executive Summary

To support 10,000 students across 25 automotive courses (300 lessons) with minimal question duplication, the LMS requires approximately **60,000-75,000 verified questions** from credible sources. This document outlines the 12-month implementation plan, source requirements, quality assurance processes, and estimated investment.

### Current Database Status
- **Total Questions:** 35
- **Verified Questions:** 25 (71%)
- **SME-Verified:** 25 (100% of verified)
- **Source Distribution:**
  - ASE: 16 questions (64%)
  - Textbook_Cengage: 3 questions (12%)
  - Textbook_Jones: 2 questions (8%)
  - SAE: 2 questions (8%)
  - EVITP: 1 question (4%)
  - OSHA: 1 question (4%)

## Question Requirements Analysis

### Student Assessment Load
**Per-Student Question Exposure:**
- Practice quizzes: 10 questions × 300 lessons = 3,000 questions
- Module exams: 25 questions × 100 modules = 2,500 questions  
- Midterm exams: 40 questions × 25 courses = 1,000 questions
- Final exams: 50 questions × 25 courses = 1,250 questions
- **Total per student:** ~7,750 questions (with overlap reduction: ~5,000 unique)

### Question Bank Size Calculation
For <1% duplication probability with 10,000 students:

**Base Requirements:**
- **300 lessons** × **150-200 questions each** = 45,000-60,000 questions
- **100 modules** × **80-100 questions each** = 8,000-10,000 questions
- **25 courses** × **120-150 questions each** = 3,000-3,750 questions

**Total Target: 56,000-73,750 questions**

### Distribution by Question Type
| Question Type | Percentage | Count (60,000 total) |
|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| Multiple Choice | 40% | 24,000 |

| True/False | 10% | 6,000 |
| Calculation | 10% | 6,000 |
| Short Answer | 10% | 6,000 |
| Fill in the Blank | 8% | 4,800 |
| Ordering/Sequencing | 4% | 2,400 |
| Matching | 3% | 1,800 |
